It leverages the Hugging Face datasets library for data loading and preprocessing, and uses a pre-trained DistilBERT model from the Transformers library for fine-tuning.\n\n## Workflow Summary\n\n    Dataset: AG News (from Hugging Face datasets)\n\n    Model: Pre-trained DistilBERT (distilbert-base-uncased)\n\n    Preprocessing: Tokenization using DistilBertTokenizer\n\n    Fine-tuning: Hugging Face Trainer API with custom training arguments\n\n    Evaluation: The model’s performance is evaluated on the test set primarily using accuracy as the key metric.\n\n    Confusion Matrix: The confusion matrix is computed and printed during evaluation to help analyze prediction errors and class-wise performance.\n\n## Inference\n\nAfter fine-tuning, the model can be used to classify new news text samples into their respective categories. The inference process involves tokenizing input sentences, passing them through the fine-tuned model, and interpreting the predicted class label along with confidence scores.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install transformers\n!pip install 'accelerate>=0.26.0'\n!pip install -U datasets huggingface_hub\n!pip install
